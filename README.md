# SettlementSurvival_TC
This is a localization mod for the video game Settlement Survival.

The mod on [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3140402190)

The mod makes the game available in Traditional Chinese (for most times).

# Known Issues:
- When first opening the game/exiting back to the main menu, texts will revert to Simplified Chineseâ€”changing the game language could resolve this issue. This issue does not carry into a new/loaded game.
- When first opening the game, it seems to take a little time for mods to take effect.
