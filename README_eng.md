This is a localization mod for the video game Settlement Survival.

The mod makes the game available in Traditional Chinese (for most times).

# Known Issues:
- When first running the game, the game is in Simplified Chinese—access the MOD panel in the main menu, then changing the game language should resolve this issue.
- When exiting back to the main menu, texts will revert to Simplified Chinese—changing the game language could resolve this issue. This issue does not carry into a new/loaded game.
